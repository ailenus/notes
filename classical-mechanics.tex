\section{The Equations of Motion}

The position of a particle in three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined by a vector \(\vct{r} \in \setreal^3\). Its
derivative \(\dis \vct{v} = \frac{\diff \vct{r}}{\diff t}\) with respect to time \(t \in \setreal\) is the
\emph{velocity of the particle}, denoted by a dot above: \(\vct{v} = \dot{\vct{r}}\). The second derivative \(\dis
\ddot{\vct{r}} = \frac{\diff^2 \vct{r}}{\diff t^2}\) is the \emph{acceleration of the particle}.

\subsection{Generalised Coordinates}

In general, the number of independent quantities which are necessary to uniquely define the position of a system is the
number of \emph{degrees of freedom of the system}. Any \(n \in \posint\) quantities \(q_1, \ldots, q_n\), each of which
is in some subset of \(\setreal\), which completely define the position of a system with \(n\) degrees of freedom are
referred to as \emph{generalised coordinates of the system}, and the derivatives \(\dot{q}_1, \ldots, \dot{q}_n\) are
its \emph{generalised velocities}. Generalised coordinates span the \emph{configuration space of the system}. We denote
generalised coordinates by an \(n\)-dimensional vector \(\vct{q}\).

In principle, if all the coordinates \(\vct{q}\) and velocities \(\dot{\vct{q}}\) of a system are simultaneously
specified for some instant, then accelerations \(\ddot{\vct{q}}\) for that instant are uniquely determined. The
relations between the coordinates, velocities, and accelerations are the \emph{equations of motions of the system},
which are second-order differential equations for the function \(\vct{q}(t)\). Solving for \(\vct{q}(t)\) makes possible
the determination of the motion of the system.

\subsection{The Stationary-Action Principle}

The most general formulation of the law governing the motion of mechanical systems is the \emph{stationary-action
principle} or the \emph{principle of least action}, according to which every mechanical system is characterised by a
definite function \(L(\vct{q}(t), \dot{\vct{q}}(t), t)\), referred to as the \emph{Lagrangian}, and the motion of the
system is such that a certain condition is satisfied.

Let the system occupy, at the instants \(t_0\) and \(t_1\), positions defined by two sets of values of the coordinates,
\(\vct{q}_0\) and \(\vct{q}_1\). Then the condition is that the system moves between these positions in such a way that
\[
  S[\vct{q}] = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} L(\vct{q}(t), \dot{\vct{q}}(t), t) \diff t
\]
is stationary. The functional \(S[\vct{q}]\) is referred to as the \emph{action}.
