\section{A Proof of the General Cauchy--Schwarz Inequality}

In this section we introduce the general Cauchy--Schwarz inequality, as well as
provide a brief proof thereof using Young's inequality.

\Bth[Cauchy--Schwarz]
For an \(x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \setreal^n\), let
\[
    \norm{x}_p = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n \abs{x_i}^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}
\]
for some \(p \in \posreal\), and let
\[
    \norm{x}_\infty = \max_{i \in \Nln} \set{\abs{x_{i + 1}}}.
\]
Then
\[
    \abs*{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i} \le \norm{x}_p \norm{y}_q
\]
wherein \(p, q \in \posreal \cup \set{\infty}\) and \(\dis \frac{1}{p}
+ \frac{1}{q} = 1\).
\Eth

\Bpr
We may assume that \(\norm{x}_p = \norm{y}_q = 1\) without loss of generality.
By Young's inequality, which states that
for \(a, b \in \nonneg\) we have \(\dis a b \le \frac{a^p}{p}
+ \frac{b^q}{q}\), we find that
\[
    \abs*{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i} \le \sum_{i = 1}^n \abs{x_i y_i} \le \sum_{i =
    1}^n \left(\frac{\abs{x_i}^p}{p} + \frac{\abs{y_i}^q}{q}\right) = 1.
\]

To prove Young's inequality, let \(\dis t = \frac{1}{p}\). Then \(\dis
\frac{1}{q} = 1 - t\). It follows that
\[
    \ln \big(t x + (1 - t) y \big) \ge t \ln x + (1 - t) \ln y. \qedhere
