\subsection{Metres}

In music, a steady and regular pulse is a \emph{beat}, which may be \emph{strong} or \emph{weak} and are grouped into
\emph{bars} or \emph{measures} separated by \emph{bar lines}. The first beat of each bar is accented and referred to as
the \emph{downbeat}.

An arrangement of rhythm into a pattern of strong and weak beats is a \emph{metre}, which is defined by a \emph{time
signature}, consisting of two stacked numbers.

\begin{lilypond}
  music = \relative {
    c d e
  }
  \score {
    \new ChoirStaff \with {
      instrumentName = "2 Fl."
    } <<
    \new Staff \transpose c c' \music
    \new Staff {
      \clef bass
      \music
    }
    >>
  }
\end{lilypond}
