\section{The Equations of Motion}

The position of a particle in three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined by
its radius vector \(\vct{r}\), whose components are its Cartesian coordinates
\(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The derivative \(\vct{v} = \diff \vct{r} / \diff t\)
of \(\vct{r}\) with respect to time \(t\) is the {\bf velocity of the
particle}, and the second derivative \(\diff^2 \vct{r} / \diff t^2\) is its
\textbf{acceleration}. We denote differentiation with respect to time by
\(\vct{v}\)
