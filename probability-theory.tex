\section{Measures}

% Suppose that \((A_n)_{n = 0}^\infty\) is a countably infinite sequence of sets. Then the \emph{limit infimum of the
% sequence} is
% \[
  % \liminf_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty \bigcap_{i = n}^\infty A_i,
% \]
% and the \emph{limit supremum thereof} is
% \[
  % \limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcap_{n = 0}^\infty \bigcup_{i = n}^\infty A_i.
% \]

\subsection{Topological Spaces}

\Bdf
  Let \(S\) be a set. Then \(\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)\) is a \emph{topology on \(S\)} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\nset \in \mathcal{T}\);
    \item \(S \in \mathcal{T}\);
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under finite intersections; and
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under unions.
  \end{enumerate}

  A \emph{topological space} is an ordered pair \((S, \mathcal{T})\) wherein \(S\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a
  topology thereon, and a subset of \(S\) is an \emph{open set} if it is in \(\mathcal{T}\).
\Edf

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(\sigma\)}{Sigma}-Algebras}

\Bdf
  Let \(S\) be a set. Then \(\varSigma \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)\) is a \emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\)} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\varSigma \ne \nset\);
    \item \(\varSigma\) is closed under complementation; and
    \item \(\varSigma\) is closed under countable unions.
  \end{enumerate}

  A \emph{measurable space} is an ordered pair \((S, \varSigma)\) wherein \(S\) is a set and \(\varSigma\) is a
  \(\sigma\)-algebra thereon, and a subset of \(S\) is a \emph{measurable set} if it is in \(\varSigma\).
\Edf

It follows that \(S \in \varSigma\) and \(\nset \in \varSigma\) for each \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) and that each
\(\sigma\)-algebra is closed under countable intersections. Hence, the smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) is \(\set{S,
\nset}\) and the largest thereon is \(\mathcal{P}(S)\).

Each \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) is also closed under monotone limits. % FIXME

The intersection of any set of \(\sigma\)-algebras is also a \(\sigma\)-algebra. For each \(P \in \mathcal{P}(S)\),
there exists a smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) containing \(P\), referred to as the \emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra
generated by \(P\)} and denoted by \(\sigma(P)\), which is obtained as the intersection of all \(\sigma\)-algebras
containing \(P\).

\Bdf
  Let \((S, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space. The \emph{Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra of \((S, \mathcal{T})\)}, denoted
  by \(\mathcal{B}(S, \mathcal{T})\), is the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(\mathcal{T}\).

  A \emph{Borel set of \((S, \mathcal{T})\)} is an element of \(\mathcal{B}(S, \mathcal{T})\).
\Edf

A \emph{\(\pi\)-system on \(S\)} is a set of subsets of \(S\) which is closed under finite intersections. A
\emph{Dynkin system on \(S\)} is a set of subsets of \(S\) which contains \(S\) and is closed under both proper
differences and increasing limits. % FIXME
