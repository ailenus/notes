\section{Measures}

Suppose that \((A_n)_{n \in \setnat}\) is a countably infinite sequence of sets. The sequence is \emph{increasing} if
\(A_n \subseteq A_{n + 1}\) for each \(n \in \setnat\), and \emph{decreasing} if \(A_{n + 1} \subseteq A_n\) for each
\(n \in \setnat\). The sequence is \emph{monotone} if it is increasing or decreasing.

If \((A_n)_{n \in \setnat}\) is increasing, the \emph{increasing union thereof} is \(\dis \bigcup_{n \in \setnat} A_n\).
If \((A_n)_{n \in \setnat}\) is decreasing, the \emph{decreasing intersection thereof} is \(\dis \bigcap_{n \in \setnat}
A_n\).

The \emph{limit inferior of the countably infinite sequence \((A_n)_{n \in \setnat}\)} is
\[
  \liminf_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty \bigcap_{i = n}^\infty A_i,
\]
and the \emph{limit superior thereof} is
\[
  \limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcap_{n = 0}^\infty \bigcup_{i = n}^\infty A_i.
\]

\subsection{Topological Spaces and \texorpdfstring{\(\sigma\)}{Sigma}-Algebras}

\Bdf
  Let \(S\) be a set. Then \(\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)\) is a \emph{topology on \(S\)} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\nset \in \mathcal{T}\);
    \item \(S \in \mathcal{T}\);
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under finite intersections; and
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under unions.
  \end{enumerate}

  A \emph{topological space} is an ordered pair \((S, \mathcal{T})\) wherein \(S\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a
  topology thereon, and a subset of \(S\) is an \emph{open set} if it is in \(\mathcal{T}\).
\Edf

For each \(\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)\), there exists a smallest topology on \(S\) which includes
\(\mathcal{S}\), referred by as the \emph{topology generated by \(\mathcal{S}\)}.

\Bdf
  Let \(S\) be a set. Then \(\varSigma \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)\) is a \emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\)} if and only if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\varSigma \ne \nset\);
    \item \(\varSigma\) is closed under complementation; and
    \item \(\varSigma\) is closed under countable unions.
  \end{enumerate}

  A \emph{measurable space} is an ordered pair \((S, \varSigma)\) wherein \(S\) is a set and \(\varSigma\) is a
  \(\sigma\)-algebra thereon, and a subset of \(S\) is a \emph{measurable set} if it is in \(\varSigma\).
\Edf

It follows that \(S \in \varSigma\) and \(\nset \in \varSigma\) for each \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) and that each
\(\sigma\)-algebra is closed under countable intersections. Hence, the smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) is \(\set{S,
\nset}\) and the largest thereon is \(\mathcal{P}(S)\).

A \(\sigma\)-algebra is closed under both increasing unions and decreasing intersections.

For each \(P \in \mathcal{P}(S)\), there exists a smallest \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(S\) which includes \(P\), referred to
as the \emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(P\)} and denoted by \(\sigma(P)\).

A \emph{\(\pi\)-system on \(S\)} is a set of subsets of \(S\) which is closed under finite intersections. A
\emph{Dynkin system on \(S\)} is a set of subsets of \(S\) which contains \(S\) and is closed under both proper
differences and increasing unions.

\Bth[Sierpi≈Ñski--Dynkin's \(\pi\)--\(\lambda\) theorem]
  Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a \(\pi\)-system on \(S\), and let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a Dynkin system thereon.

  If \(\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{D}\), then \(\sigma(\mathcal{C}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}\).
\Eth
\Bpr
  First, \(\mathcal{C}\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra if and only if it is both a \(\pi\)-system and a Dynkin system.

  Assume that \(\mathcal{D}\) is the smallest Dynkin system which includes \(\mathcal{C}\). It then suffices to show
  that \(\mathcal{D}\) is also a \(\pi\)-system. Hence, we need to show that \(A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}\) for any
  \(A, B \in \mathcal{D}\).

  To demonstrate the above proposition, first define \(\mathcal{S}_B = \set{A \subseteq S : A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}}\)
  for each \(B \in \mathcal{C}\). Then each \(\mathcal{S}_B\) is a Dynkin system including \(\mathcal{C}\), and so it
  includes \(\mathcal{D}\). Thus, \(A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}\) for each \(A \in \mathcal{D}\) and \(B \in \mathcal{C}\).
  Next, define \(\mathcal{S}'_A = \set{B \subseteq S : A \cap B \in \mathcal{D}}\) for each \(A \in \mathcal{D}\).
  Similarly, we note that each \(\mathcal{S}'_A\) includes \(\mathcal{D}\).

  Therefore, the theorem holds.
\Epr

\Bdf
  Let \((S, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space. The \emph{Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra of \((S, \mathcal{T})\)}, denoted
  by \(\mathcal{B}(S, \mathcal{T})\), is the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(\mathcal{T}\).

  A \emph{Borel set of \((S, \mathcal{T})\)} is an element of \(\mathcal{B}(S, \mathcal{T})\).
\Edf

Let \((S_i, \mathcal{T}_i)_{i \in I}\) be topological spaces with \(I\) as an index set. Let \(\mathcal{X}\) be the
cartesian product of \((S_i)_{i \in I}\); i.e.,
\[
  \mathcal{X} = \prod_{i \in I} S_i.
\]
For each \(i \in I\), let \(\map{\text{pr}_i}{\mathcal{X}}{S_i}\) denote the \(i\)-th projection on \(\mathcal{X}\);
i.e.,
\[
  \text{pr}_i(x) = s_i
\]
wherein \(x = (s_i)_{i \in I}\). Then, the \emph{product topology on \(\mathcal{X}\)} is the topology generated by
\[
  \set{\text{pr}_i^{-1}[U] : U \in \mathcal{T}_i \land i \in I}.
\]

Let \((S_i, \varSigma_i)_{i \in I}\) be measurable spaces with \(I\) as an index set. The \emph{product
\(\sigma\)-algebra of \((\varSigma_i)_{i \in I}\)} is
\[
  \bigotimes_{i \in I} \varSigma_i = \sigma\left(\set*{A_i \times \prod_{j \in I \land j \ne i} S_j :
  A_i \in \varSigma_i \land i \in I}\right).
\]
